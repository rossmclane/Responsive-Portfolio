            <p>
                Hey, I'm Ross! I'm a graduate of Georgia Tech with a degree in Applied Physics. Currently, I'm a Data
                Scientist under contract with The Rocky Mountain Institute working
                to accelerate the adoption of EVs globally. I'm also enrolled in the Georgia Tech Full Stack Web
                Development bootcamp. Take a look around and sendm e a note if you have any questions!
            </p>
            Throughout this bootcamp, I'm looking forward to learning all aspects of the stack and finding an area of
            the stack that I'm particularly interested in. I'm very interested in using digital devices as a medium for
            story-telling, so that will be something that I'll be focusing my time on in my projects. Keep an eye on my
            GitHub if you want to see where I'm at with projects!
            <p>
